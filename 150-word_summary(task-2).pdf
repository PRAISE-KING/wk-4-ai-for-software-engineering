AI-powered test automation significantly enhances test coverage compared to manual testing. Tools like Testim.io and Selenium IDE with AI plugins can automatically detect UI changes, suggest test steps, and adapt test cases over time. This minimizes the need to manually update tests when the UI layout changes â€” a major bottleneck in traditional automation.

In our example, we tested a login form with both valid and invalid credentials. While manual testing would require repetitive input, AI-enabled tools can record flows, identify patterns, and suggest edge case scenarios like empty fields or SQL injection attempts.

Moreover, AI-driven testing ensures scalability. Once tests are generated, they can be run across multiple browsers and devices automatically, something impractical to manage manually. AI also reduces false positives by learning from historical results and behavior.

Ultimately, AI empowers testers to focus on high-value analysis rather than tedious script maintenance, improving quality and speed across CI/CD pipelines.
